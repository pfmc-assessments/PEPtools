#' Install packages for R
#'
#' Install devtools with all of its dependencies, i.e.,
#' \code{dependencies = c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo", "Suggests")}
#' such that many packages that are needed downstream are installed.
#' 
#' @details
#' Install packages from the cloud R-project repository using a single
#' call to install \pkg{devtools}. A single call is facilitated by
#' including \code{"Suggests"} in the dependencies argument.
#' The functionality of \code{r_install} is mainly useful for those
#' that update R on a regular basis. For example, developers of R packages
#' will want to install the development version of R at least monthly.
