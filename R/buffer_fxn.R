#' Buffer calculation for U.S. West Coast Groundfish Stocks
#' Applies the time-varying sigma approach based on the 2019
#' approach.
#' @param years the years to generate buffer values for
#' @param sigma the sigma value to use (cat 1 = 0.50, cat 2 = 1.0, cat 3 = 2.0)
#' @param pstar managment uncertainty value (i.e., 0.45, 0.40)
#' @examples
