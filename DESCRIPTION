Description: The package contains various tools that are useful to 
    scientists at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC)
    in the Population Ecology Program (PEP). Users typically spend the
    majority of their time producing assessments of groundfish stock off the
    US West Coast. Though, many of the tools will also be useful for 
    the general science they conduct as well.
